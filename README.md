# Hello, Y'all! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I've been coding for nearly three years already, and I'm only 15. It all began with Minecraft modding at the age of twelve. Now I'm into Python, C#, and C++. While I am strong at coding, my major focus is cybersecurity. As a red teamer, I utilize tools such as Metasploit to pentesting. I enjoy learning and want to excel in both coding and cybersecurity.
